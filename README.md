# WeatherJS v1.0
Current weather app

User inputs a location and it displays the weather, together with current temperature, min and max temperatures, wind direction and speed etc. It is most accurate if user enters both city and country code, separated by a comma, eg "paris,fr", but it also accepts plain city names or even greater regions or states, like "california". The app uses localStorage to save the location entered.

v1.0: Again created as part of a udemy.com course. However I switched to another API (https://openweathermap.org/), as the one the course suggested was not free anymore and made a lot of changes myself to make best use of the new API and provide an even better user experience (converted wind direction degrees to literal directions, added arrows etc).
