# WeatherJS v1.0
Current weather app

User inputs a location and it displays the weather, together with current temperature, min and max temperatures, wind direction and speed etc. It is most accurate if user enters both city and country code, separated by a comma, eg "paris,fr", but it also accepts plain city names or even greater regions or states, like "california". The app uses localStorage to preserve the location entered.

API used is OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/). 

v1.0: Switched to OpenWeatherMap API. Added min/max temp. Converted wind direction degrees to literal directions, added arrows.
